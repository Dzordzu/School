## About
<div id="about"></div>
Genetic algorithm is meta-heuristic term.
It basically means modifying genotype (set of zeros and ones),
in order to get an optimal solution in a rational time.

The fact is that Genetic algorithm is not an algorithm, but an
abstract term generalizing set of methods. Be aware of this fact.
